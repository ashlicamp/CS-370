# CS-370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code I was given included two Python files that acted as game setup. I created code to implement the Deep Q Learning algorithm and achieve success in the pathfinding problem.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists use machines to solve problems. Technology is an ever-advancing field that has made life easier in a lot of ways and has even saved lives, especially in the medical field. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Problems should be approached as objectively and ethically as possible. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
There are many ethical responsibilities to both users and the organization. This could include avoiding hidden bias, keeping transparency in code with comments, and much more.
